# Development

- Install Python 3.11+, ideally with [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
- Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/): `pip install poetry`
- Install dependencies: `poetry install`
- Use scripts for repo to check if everything works: `./scripts/build.sh`
- Run manual pre-commit: `./scripts/before_commit.sh`
